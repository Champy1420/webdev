      <p><i>About Us:</i> <br> We were founded in 2019 and have expanded faster than we ever thought we would! If my son was sick, I couldn't go to work and I wasn't paid.  That is when I realized that other single moms also needed help at times but as a one income family, you can't always budget for additional childcare.  That is when I made this network of parents who had services to offer but also needed help from time to time.  Putting us all in touch with one another, we created a village, that we all could trust and feel comfortable leaving our children with for those moments we needed help.  Our group of parents are our biggest supporters as they volunteer their time and welcome new members while recruiting others they think would benefit the club.  This club was started because as a mother myself, I would have events where I needed a babysitter in my home while I was in college and broke.  I came up with the idea to trade services and our group grew from there! We love our members, we support our members and want to hear from you!

    <p><i>About the Founder:</i> <br> Being a single mom at one point in my life, I was forced to rely on anyone I could find available for my son at that time.  I wasn't always thrilled with my choice and it just added to my stress.  I didn't have a set network of people who I could rely on as I lived in a state differ from the rest of my family.  Working full-time and going to school at night - I had many instances where I could have used some help. Now that I'm married, I have had two more children since - a boy and a girl.  I still maintain this club but am not proactively sitting and enjoying the great benefits we have to offer.
