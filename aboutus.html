      <p class="boxtest"><i>About Us:</i> We were founded in 2019 and have expanded faster than we ever thought we would! Our group of parents are our biggest supporters as they volunteer their time and welcome new members while recruiting others they think would benefit the club.  This club was started because as a mother myself, I would have events where I needed a babysitter in my home while I was in college and broke.  I came up with the idea to trade services and our group grew from there! We <b class="term">love</b> our members, we support our members and want to hear from you! <em>Sign up today</em>!<p>
