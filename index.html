  <p>Have you ever needed a babysitter but wanted to use someone you could trust and didnâ€™t cost you a fortune? This group utilizes childcare with a network of parents who have been <i>CPR trained</i> and cleared a background check to be hired for babysitting.  What makes our group different than other hired help to watch your children is that you volunteer your time to babysit for another to build up points to use as cash to purchase your babysitting needs.  This community is a tight-nit group that stays in contact with one another as a support group that understands how difficult it is raising children.  As they say, it takes a village to raise a child, this is our modern-day village.

      <p><i>About Us:</i> We were founded in 2019 and have expanded faster than we ever thought we would! Our group of parents are our biggest supporters as they volunteer their time and welcome new members while recruiting others they think would benefit the club.  This club was started because as a mother myself, I would have events where I needed a babysitter in my home while I was in college and broke.  I came up with the idea to trade services and our group grew from there! We <b class="term">love</b> our members, we support our members and want to hear from you! <em>Sign up today</em>!<p>
