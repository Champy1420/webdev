  <p>Have you ever needed a babysitter but wanted to use someone you could trust and didnâ€™t cost you a fortune? This group utilizes childcare with a network of parents who have been <i>CPR trained</i> and cleared a background check to be hired for babysitting.  What makes our group different than other hired help to watch your children is that you volunteer your time to babysit for another to build up points to use as cash to purchase your babysitting needs.  This community is a tight-nit group that stays in contact with one another as a support group that understands how difficult it is raising children.  As they say, it takes a village to raise a child, this is our modern-day village.
