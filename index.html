    Have you ever needed a babysitter but wanted to use someone you could trust and didnâ€™t cost you a fortune? This group utilizes childcare with a network of parents who have been CPR trained and cleared a background check to be hired for babysitting.  What makes our group different than other hired help to watch your children is that you volunteer your time to babysit for another to build up points to use as cash to purchase your babysitting needs.  This community is a tight-nit group that stays in contact with one another as a support group that understands how difficult it is raising children.  As they say, it takes a village to raise a child, this is our modern-day village.
 </p>

 <p>
   How this group works - each participant completes an application.  After your background check comes back cleared, we schedule a home visit interview.  During this interview, we meet with you and your children to get a feel for your home atmosphere.  We also ask questions to get to know you better based on what certifications you have, what special talents and trainings you have so we can help match up babysitting duties.  Then when we are both in agreement, we enlist your talents in the babysitting pool for those seeking a babysitter to choose from available sitters.  Once you have accumulated 10 hours of sitting duties, you can start spending your hours worked.  For every 3 hours in your bank, you get 1 hour of babysitting to spend.  There is no minimum or maximum of how many hours you can spend at one time other than what both parties agree to before the start of the appointed date.  Babysitting is usually done in the child's home unless other arrangements are made and agreed upon ahead of time.<em>If your interested, fill out the application and we will be in touch</em>.
